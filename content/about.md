### We are committed to using our unique blend of technical expertise and multidisciplinary knowledge to provide reverse engineering services to labor union and other actors.

### Our mission is to hold gig-economy apps accountable for their covert practices and ensure that labor violations are brought to light.

### By bridging the skills gap in the union sector, we aim to become indispensable advisors and advocates for transparency and fairness in the digital workforce.

### **This is reversing.works, the Reverse Engineering Task Force**.

# Background

Originally established as part of [Tracking Exposed](https://tracking.exposed), this group has accumulated extensive experience in the field of platform accountability, employing various approaches including reverse engineering. When Tracking Exposed underwent restructuring and became [AI Forensics](https://aiforensics.org) in early 2023, **reversing.works** assumed a more specialized role, emphasizing workers' rights and the influence of algorithms and surveillance on them.

This team of experts builds upon prior experiences, particularly in a phase marked by significant shifts in the political and regulatory landscape surrounding the platform economy.
