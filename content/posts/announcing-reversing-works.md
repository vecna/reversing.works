In Spring 2023, the project [Tracking Exposed](https://tracking.exposed) concluded. This led to the emergence of various new initiatives.

Reverse Engineering Task Force is also the group that would continue the efforts described in this [report](posts/2023/09/exercising-workers-rights-in-algorithmic-management-systems/).

Today we announce the [Reverse Engineering Task Force](https://reversing.works). The [team](/about), is committed to supporting trade unions, policy-makers, and informal worker groups grappling with digital challenges.

Expect website updates in the coming months. For contact, please email `staff@reversing.works`.
