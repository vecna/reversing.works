In Spring 2023, the project [Tracking Exposed](https://tracking.exposed) concluded. This led to the emergence of various new initiatives.

One notable initiative is [AI Forensics](https://aiforensics.org). However, it won't cover trade unions, gig economy, or mobile app reverse engineering.


Addressing these areas, **today we announce the [Reverse Engineering Task Force](https://reversing.works)**. The team, detailed [here](/about), is committed to supporting trade unions, policy-makers, and informal worker groups grappling with digital challenges.

Reverse Engineering Task Force is also the group that would continue the efforts described in this [report](posts/2023/09/exercising-workers-rights-in-algorithmic-management-systems/).

Expect website updates in the coming months. For contact, please email `staff@reversing.works`.
