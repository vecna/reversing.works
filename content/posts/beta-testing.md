[Reversing.works](http://Reversing.works) is looking for technical beta testers. Help us empower workers against their employer’s surveillance by testing our tool WebUSB Unpinner.

We just released the [first iteration](https://reversing.works/posts/2025/12/webusb-unpinner-network-analysis-for-the-masses/) of WebUSB Unpinner, a tool central to our process of investigation. We want workers with limited technical skills to be able to investigate the traffic between the app they use for working and the servers of their employer.

### Requirements

- A phone with android
- A basic knowledge of the command-line interface

### How can you help

- We invite you to follow our [documentation](https://github.com/fisiognomico/webusb-unpinner), install and run the tool. Report any doubt or improvement in the [issues](https://github.com/fisiognomico/webusb-unpinner/issues) of our repository. Any suggestion can help us make the onboarding easier for inexperienced user.
- Take an app, possibly a complex, commercial app you’re using and run it through WebUSB Unpinner. Some will fail, because WebUSB Unpinner is not perfect. This information is extremely important for us. Report it in the issues of the project.
- If at this point you’ve become familiar with WebUSB Unpinner, consider to run a little workshop with frieds or colleagues to investigate an app that might be surveiling them. If you do, feel free to reach out to  [staff@reversing.works](mailto:staff@reversing.works) for support or to report your results.
- Circulate this call among friends and colleagues. We want a diverse set of people with a varying level of expertise to test our tool.

Thank you very much for taking an interest in helping reversing.works. Together we make workers stronger.
