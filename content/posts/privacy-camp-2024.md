Clearly the description has been produce when the European Platform Directive was still a realistic work in progress, which is not anymore the case ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤·

* To map/understand how much overlap/synergies are between digital rights activists and platform workersâ€™ challenges.
* To exchange on grassroots approaches (our research at reversing.works and Worker info Exchange and your work).
* To see if/how the Platform Worker Directive will give us more tools
* To explore how can trade unions and workers practically use the Platform Worker Directive to challenge the power dynamics of the gig economy, and how can we do without it?

### About us

We are organising this session to look at the gig economy as a new space that deserves a strong commitment to accountability and rights, and to talk and engage with other actors in the network, actors who share a similar multidisciplinary approach. 
The Privacy Camp represents a gathering of activists and digital rights advocates that can potentially advance the debate around digital investigations in the labour sector.
