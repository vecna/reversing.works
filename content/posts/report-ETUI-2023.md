### New challenges for workers’rights

According to the authors of this ETUI’s report, collecting evidence about algorithmic management is critical for workers seeking to enforce their rights by filing complaints with national DPAs or competent courts.

The availability of technical expertise can also help improve workers’ negotiating positions in a collective bargaining context. Ultimately, we believe that, by helping workers understand the apps that control them, we can give them the key to unlock their rights and build a fairer future of work for all.
