<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Originally established as part of <a href="https://tracking.exposed">Tracking Exposed</a>, this group has accumulated extensive experience in the field of platform accountability, employing various approaches including reverse engineering. When Tracking Exposed underwent restructuring and became <a href="https://aiforensics.org">AI Forensics</a> in early 2023, the <strong>Reverse Engineering Task Force</strong> assumed a more specialized role, emphasizing workers&rsquo; rights and the influence of algorithms and surveillance on them.</p>
<p>This team of experts builds upon prior experiences, particularly in a phase marked by significant shifts in the political and regulatory landscape surrounding the platform economy.</p>
